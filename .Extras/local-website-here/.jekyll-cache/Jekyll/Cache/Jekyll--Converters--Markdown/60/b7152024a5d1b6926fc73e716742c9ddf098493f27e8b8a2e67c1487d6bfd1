<p>I am currently a Post Doc at the <a href="http://dei.udel.edu">Delaware Energy Institute</a>, University of Delaware, Newark. Broadly, my work aims to analyse and develop new technologies for manufacturing that rely on sustainably generated electric energy.</p>

<p>My PhD thesis completed at the <a href="https://www.chbe.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> investigated the transport of phonons and thermal energy in nanostructured semiconductors enabling quanitative predictions of the flow of energy.</p>

<p>I am also interested in data science and enjoy understanding the to the world around us quantitatively. In a past life, I worked in a petrochemical refinery and managed the production of a printing and packaging line.</p>

<p>If you are interested in what I do, or believe we can collaborate on something exciting, or just want to say hi, look me up on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/dracodormien">Twitter</a> or drop me an <a href="mailto: contact@abhinavm.com">e-mail</a>!</p>
