        <title>Understanding Indian Premier League with Data Science</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;Quantifying success, efficiency and performance in the richest league of cricket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian Premier League, or IPL, is a cricket league that began in 2008. In more than a decade it has transformed the landscape of cricket not only in India but across the world. This transformation has been achieved by immense amount of money that has been pumped into cricket especially by IPL teams during player auctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPL is now the most-attended cricket league in the world and has a brand value of ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion). According to some reports, IPL contributed approximately US$200 million to the GDP of the Indian economy. With the staggering amount of money available, IPL promises a chance for young Indian cricketers fighting for limited playing positions available in international cricket to become financially stable for the rest of their lives. Players are purchased at an annual auction (which has some complex mechanisms such as player retention, not needed for our analysis here) by one of the IPL teams (currently 8 active).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Entering the Matrix: ELI5 Introduction to Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;newthought&quot;&gt;I am trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is motivated by my effort to explain matrices and their special properties without having to resort to typical mathematical language.
Matrices are a strange beast, look mathematical devoid of all physical intuition, and yet are so powerful that they underlie foundational mathematics, statistics and even quantum mechanics. Lets bring some intuition to their working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, free your mind of any associations that you may have with mathematical terminologies of vectors, spaces, basis or even matrices. Lets delve into a magical world with our protagonist, Wincerind, an acquaintance at best of another colorful fella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine a magical compass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wincerind finds it in an old witch’s home, but doesn’t know what that compass does, or what its powers are. In turmoil, he turn to sleep hoping for an answer the next day, like all great men often do. In his dreams, Morpheus appears and reveals to him that the compass is a size changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What?”, Wincerind awakes, hearing the magical cauldron he put on heat last night burst. He wonders, “a compass that is a size changer, hmm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tired by his forced late night cauldron cleaning, Wincerind falls into another deep slumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Oracle appears in his dreams and says, “Morpheus is a fool, he doesn’t know the true nature of this compass. This compass is a direction changer.”
“Not again!”, Wincerind shouts, hearing the whistle of the kettle that he put on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is too awake now to do anything but test who is correct, Morpheus or Oracle.
In a true scientific manner, Wincerind decides to test the effect of the compass. He decides to use the magical compass on a VicVac. He looks into his basket of magical creatures and find a small VicVac. For those unfamiliar, VicVacs are magical beasts that are composed of parts of different animals. The one in his basket is one part ibex and two parts jackal.&lt;/p&gt;
