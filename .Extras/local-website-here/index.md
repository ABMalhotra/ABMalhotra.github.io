I am currently a Post Doc at the [Delaware Energy Institute](http://dei.udel.edu), University of Delaware, Newark. Broadly, my work aims to analyse and develop new technologies for manufacturing that rely on sustainably generated electric energy. My PhD thesis investigated the transport of phonons and thermal energy in nanostructured semiconductors enabling quanitative predictions of the flow of energy.

I am also interested in data science and enjoy understanding the to the world around us quantitatively. In a past life, I worked in a petrochemical refinery and managed the production of a printing and packaging line. 

If you are interested in what I do, or believe we can collaborate on something exciting, or just want to say hi, look me up on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/dracodormien) or drop me an [e-mail](mailto: contact@abhinavm.com)!
