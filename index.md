I am a chemical engineer with research interests in advancing the understanding of energy science with the objective of **enabling novel, efficient and economically-viable sustainable energy technologies**. Specifically, I am interested in *rationally leveraging transport phenomena and kinetics over multiple length and time scales*, to enable efficient electron-photon-phonon mediated energy and chemical transformation processes.
