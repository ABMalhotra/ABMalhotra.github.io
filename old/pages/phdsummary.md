My PhD research was focused on computationally understanding thermal energy transport from the nano to macro-scale in semiconductors. At the small length scales of nanostructures, heat flow is influenced by phenomena absent at the macro-scale. As a consequence, heat conduction at the nanoscale is no longer described by classical Fourier's theory. In my research, I used statistical transport theory to predict the flow of heat. Such heat-flux engineering is central to improving the efficiencies of [thermoelectric technologies](https://www.nature.com/subjects/thermoelectrics){:target="_blank"} for waste-heat recovery, [optoelectronic devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optoelectronics){:target="_blank"} (such as solar cells, lasers and photo-detectors) and industrial [chemical engineering equipment](https://www.aiche.org/rapid/projects/list){:target="_blank"} (heat exchangers and chemical reactors).
